# summar.pl

Summar.pl is an automatic summarization system developed for the Polish language. The system implements trainable sentence-based extractive summarization technique, which consists in determining most important sentences in document due to their computed salience. Neural networks were used as a machine learning algorithm (Pybrain library, as well as FANN were used).

The system was implemented during work on Master Thesis's in computer science at Feculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Adam Mickiewicz University. For more innformation see http://summar.pl

More info, as well as simple usage will be added soon.
